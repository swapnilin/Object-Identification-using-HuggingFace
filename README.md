## Description

The Image Description and Audio Transcript App is a web-based application that leverages artificial intelligence to generate descriptions for uploaded images. Additionally, the tool provides an audio transcript of the description for users with visual impairments, making it more accessible.

This app uses BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) for image captioning and gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) for converting the description into an audio file.

## Features

* Upload an image and receive an AI-generated description.
* Convert the description into an audio file for accessibility.
* Responsive web interface built using Gradio.
* Simple, user-friendly design for a seamless experience.

## Technologies Used

* Programming Language: Python 3.7+
* AI Model: BLIP for image captioning
* Text-to-Speech: gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)
* Web Interface: Gradio
* Libraries: PyTorch, Transformers, Gradio, gTTS

## Libraries and Dependencies

* torch: Deep learning framework for the BLIP model
* transformers: Hugging Face library for pre-trained models like BLIP
* gtts: Library for text-to-speech conversion
* gradio: For building the web interface

## To install the necessary packages, run:

```bash
pip install torch transformers gtts gradio
```

## Installation and Setup

* Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/image-description-audio-transcript.git
cd image-description-audio-transcript`

* Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
`python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate`

* Install the required packages:
`pip install torch transformers gtts gradio`

* Ensure that the necessary models are downloaded: The BLIP model will automatically be downloaded when the script is run, and gTTS will use an online service to convert text to speech.

## Usage

1. Run the application:
2. python app.py
3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:7860 to access the app.
4. Upload an image through the provided input.
5. Click the Generate Description button to get a text description of the image.
6. Click the Click here for an audio transcript button to hear the description.

## Configuration

You can modify the following parameters in the app.py file:

* host: The IP address on which the server runs (default: '127.0.0.1')
* port: The port number (default: 7860)
* debug: Debug mode for development (default: True)
